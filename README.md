Test_A brand new start in using GitHub

Hello, there. I am Xuechun on 2017/9/14. This is my first day having an Internship in Didi. It's a little boring the first day so that I begin learing GitHub by myself. This platform, as mentioned several times by other people, is pretty important for the 码农. I hope I could master the knoeledge as soon as possible. 
Hope you have already grown up when seeing this repository again! :)
